Here’s a paraphrased version of your `pubspec.yaml` file with descriptions:

---

Project Metadata

- name: `social_media_app`
- description: A new Flutter project.

The `publish_to: 'none'` line prevents this package from being inadvertently published on pub.dev. Remove this line if you intend to publish the package.

Versioning

The app version is specified using `version: 1.0.0+1`, where the version format is `major.minor.patch+build_number`. For Android, `build-name` corresponds to `versionName` and `build-number` to `versionCode` ([more on Android versioning](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning)). For iOS, these map to `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion` ([more on iOS versioning](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html)).

Environment

- Dart SDK compatibility: `>=2.17.5 <3.0.0`

Dependencies

Dependencies list other packages required for the app’s functionality. Run `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` to update dependencies or manually change versions below to the latest available on pub.dev. Check for outdated packages with `flutter pub outdated`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  google_fonts: ^3.0.1
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.1
  flutter_blurhash: ^0.7.0
```

Dev Dependencies

For testing and linting, the following packages are added:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0
```

Flutter-specific Configuration

```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

This includes the Material Icons font, enabling access to Material Design icons through the `Icons` class.

Assets

To include assets, specify them as shown below:

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/images/
  - assets/json/
```

Refer to [resolution-aware assets](https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware) for guidance on using multiple resolutions.

Fonts

Custom fonts can be added by defining each font family and listing available font styles:

```yaml
fonts:
  - family: CustomFont
    fonts:
      - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
      - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
```

For adding fonts from other packages, see [using fonts from packages](https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages).
